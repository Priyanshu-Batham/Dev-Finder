# Dev Finder

This is one of the side projects I created to sharpen my webdev skills.
## Hosting DB
During the development I have been using a postgreSQL database which I run locally through a docker container. On production I used Vercel's one and only postgreSQL database, so now for other projects I have look elsewhere :)
